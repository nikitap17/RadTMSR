## Supplementary Analysis: Occurrence of 'Mental Health' across Time

As many scholars who introduce radicalization theories advocate moving away from studying mental health, we examined the frequency of mental health-related phenomena in publications over time, confirming an overall decreasing trend. We present frequency of 'mental health' in both the keyword and abstract corpus.

### Analysis 1: Keywords

Researchers frequently assert that terrorist actions can be committed by anyone, highlighting environmental factors rather than a narrow psychopathological diagnosis. This view, however, may be outdated due to its categorical approach to psychopathology. With the advent of the ICD-11 (World Health Organization, 2019) and the recognition of mental health as a spectrum, there is an opportunity to rejuvenate radicalization studies, particularly by examining how mental health intersects with meso- and macro-level influences.
