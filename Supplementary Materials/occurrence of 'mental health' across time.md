## Supplementary Analysis: Occurrence of 'Mental Health' across Time

As many scholars who introduce radicalization theories advocate moving away from studying mental health, we examined the frequency of mental health-related phenomena in publications over time, confirming an overall decreasing trend. We present the frequency of 'mental health' in both the keyword and abstract corpus.

Researchers frequently assert that terrorist actions can be committed by anyone, highlighting environmental factors rather than a narrow psychopathological diagnosis. This view, however, may be outdated due to its categorical approach to psychopathology. With the advent of the ICD-11 (World Health Organization, 2019) and the recognition of mental health as a spectrum, there is an opportunity to revitalize radicalization studies, particularly by examining how mental health intersects with meso- and macro-level influences.
