## Supplementary Analysis: Frequencies of Regional Terms 
<br>

In this supplementary file, we present the frequency of terms related to regions that appear in both keywords (Analysis 1) and abstracts (Analysis 2). These terms were excluded from the main analyses reported in the manuscript, as they were not deemed relevant to our research focus. The regional terms listed are unfiltered and uncategorized.
